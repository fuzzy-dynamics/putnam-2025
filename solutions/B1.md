# Putnam 2025 B1 - Solution

## Answer

All points of the plane are the same color.

## Solution

**Key Observation:** If a point $X$ is red, then every circle centered at $X$ contains at most two green points.

*Proof:* Suppose some circle $C$ centered at $X$ contains three or more green points. Any three points on a circle are noncollinear (since a line intersects a circle in at most two points). Thus we can choose three noncollinear green points $A, B, D$ on $C$. The circumcenter of three noncollinear points lying on a circle is the center of that circle. Hence the circumcenter of $A, B, D$ is $X$. By the given condition, $X$ must be green, contradicting that $X$ is red.

By an identical argument, if $Y$ is green, every circle centered at $Y$ contains at most two red points.

**Main Proof:**

Suppose for contradiction that there exists a red point $X$ and a green point $Y$. Let $d = |XY| > 0$.

Consider three concentric circles $P_1, P_2, P_3$ centered at $X$ and four concentric circles $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4$ centered at $Y$, with distinct radii all chosen in the interval $(d/2, d/2 + \varepsilon)$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$. This ensures each $P_i$ intersects each $Q_j$ in exactly two points (since the sum of radii exceeds $d$ and the absolute difference of radii is less than $d$).

By the Key Observation:
- Each $P_i$ contains at most 2 green points (since $X$ is red).
- Each $Q_j$ contains at most 2 red points (since $Y$ is green).

**Step 1:** The sets $P_1 \cap Q_1, P_1 \cap Q_2, P_1 \cap Q_3, P_1 \cap Q_4$ are pairwise disjoint (since $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4$ are pairwise disjoint), and each contains exactly 2 points. Thus $P_1$ contains these 8 points.

Since $P_1$ has at most 2 green points, at least 6 of these 8 points are red.

These 8 points partition into 4 pairs. With at most 2 green among them, at most 2 pairs can contain a green point. Therefore, at least 2 pairs consist entirely of red points. WLOG, both points of $P_1 \cap Q_1$ are red and both points of $P_1 \cap Q_2$ are red.

**Step 2:** Circle $Q_1$ now has 2 red points (namely $P_1 \cap Q_1$). Since $Q_1$ can have at most 2 red points, every other point on $Q_1$ is green. In particular, $P_2 \cap Q_1 \subset Q_1 \setminus P_1$ consists of 2 green points. (Here we use that $P_1$ and $P_2$ are disjoint, being concentric circles with distinct radii.)

By the same reasoning, $P_2 \cap Q_2$ consists of 2 green points.

Since $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are disjoint, the sets $P_2 \cap Q_1$ and $P_2 \cap Q_2$ are disjoint. Thus $P_2$ contains at least 4 green points.

**Step 3:** But $X$ is red, so by the Key Observation, $P_2$ can have at most 2 green points. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, both a red point and a green point cannot exist simultaneously. Hence all points of the plane are the same color.
