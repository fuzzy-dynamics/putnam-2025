# Putnam 2025 A1 - Solution

## Answer

For all but finitely many positive integers $k$, we have $\gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1) = 1$.

## Solution

We prove that the sequence $d_k := \gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1)$ eventually reaches and remains at 1.

### Setup and Notation

Let $a_k = 2m_k + 1$ and $b_k = 2n_k + 1$. Define:

- $d_k = \gcd(a_k, b_k)$
- $\delta_k = |a_k - b_k| = 2|m_k - n_k|$

**Observation 1:** $d_k$ is always odd (since $a_k$ and $b_k$ are both odd).

**Observation 2:** $d_k \mid \delta_k$ (the gcd divides the difference).

### Recurrence Relation

From the problem definition, $\frac{m_k}{n_k} = \frac{a_{k-1}}{b_{k-1}}$ in lowest terms. This means:
$$m_k = \frac{a_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}, \quad n_k = \frac{b_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$$

Therefore:
$$a_k = 2m_k + 1 = \frac{2a_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}} + 1$$
$$b_k = 2n_k + 1 = \frac{2b_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}} + 1$$

Subtracting:
$$\delta_k = |a_k - b_k| = \frac{2|a_{k-1} - b_{k-1}|}{d_{k-1}} = \frac{2\delta_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$$

### Key Lemma: Odd Part Descent

Write $\delta_k = 2^{e_k} \cdot o_k$ where $o_k$ is the odd part of $\delta_k$ (i.e., $o_k$ is odd and $e_k \geq 0$).

**Lemma:** $o_k = \dfrac{o_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$ for all $k \geq 1$.

**Proof:** We have $\delta_k = \frac{2\delta_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}} = \frac{2 \cdot 2^{e_{k-1}} \cdot o_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}} = 2^{e_{k-1}+1} \cdot \frac{o_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$.

Since $d_{k-1}$ is odd (Observation 1) and $d_{k-1} \mid \delta_{k-1} = 2^{e_{k-1}} \cdot o_{k-1}$, we must have $d_{k-1} \mid o_{k-1}$.

Therefore $\frac{o_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$ is an integer, and since both $o_{k-1}$ and $d_{k-1}$ are odd, this quotient is odd. Hence $o_k = \frac{o_{k-1}}{d_{k-1}}$.

### Main Argument

The sequence $o_0, o_1, o_2, \ldots$ consists of positive odd integers satisfying $o_k = o_{k-1}/d_{k-1}$.

**Case 1:** If $d_k = 1$ for all $k \geq 0$, then the theorem is trivially true (there are zero exceptions).

**Case 2:** Suppose $d_k > 1$ for some $k$. Since $d_k$ is odd and $d_k > 1$, we have $d_k \geq 3$.

By the Lemma, $o_{k+1} = o_k / d_k \leq o_k / 3 < o_k$.

Therefore, whenever $d_k > 1$, the odd part $o_k$ strictly decreases.

**Claim:** $m_k \neq n_k$ for all $k \geq 0$.

*Proof:* Suppose $m_k = n_k$ for some $k \geq 1$. Then $\frac{m_k}{n_k} = 1$, so $\frac{2m_{k-1}+1}{2n_{k-1}+1} = 1$ in lowest terms, which requires $m_{k-1} = n_{k-1}$. By backward induction, $m_0 = n_0$, contradicting that $m_0$ and $n_0$ are distinct.

Therefore $\delta_k = 2|m_k - n_k| > 0$ for all $k$, so $o_k$ is always a positive integer.

Since $o_k$ strictly decreases whenever $d_k > 1$, there can only be **finitely many** values of $k$ for which $d_k > 1$.

### Conclusion

After finitely many steps, we have $d_k = 1$ for all sufficiently large $k$.

Therefore, $\gcd(2m_k+1, 2n_k+1) = 1$ for all but finitely many positive integers $k$.
