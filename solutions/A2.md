# Putnam 2025 A2 - Solution

## Answer

$$a = \frac{1}{\pi}, \quad b = \frac{4}{\pi^2}$$

## Solution

We seek constants $a, b$ such that $a \cdot x(\pi - x) \leq \sin x \leq b \cdot x(\pi - x)$ for all $x \in [0, \pi]$.

### Step 1: Boundary Behavior

Both $\sin x$ and $x(\pi - x)$ vanish at $x = 0$ and $x = \pi$, so the inequalities hold trivially at the endpoints. The content lies in the interior.

### Step 2: Lower Bound ($a = 1/\pi$)

Differentiating both sides of $\sin x \geq a \cdot x(\pi - x)$, a necessary condition at points of equality is:
$$\cos x \geq a(\pi - 2x)$$

At the endpoint $x = 0$, both functions equal zero. For the inequality to be tight there, we need the derivatives to satisfy $\cos(0) \geq a \cdot \pi$, giving $a \leq 1/\pi$.

We now verify $a = 1/\pi$ works. On $[0, \pi/2]$, observe that $\cos x$ is concave (since $\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\cos x = -\cos x \leq 0$). The linear function $L(x) = \frac{\pi - 2x}{\pi}$ satisfies:
- $L(0) = 1 = \cos(0)$
- $L(\pi/2) = 0 = \cos(\pi/2)$

Since $\cos x$ is concave and $L(x)$ is the secant line through these endpoints, we have $\cos x \geq L(x)$ on $[0, \pi/2]$, i.e.:
$$\cos x \geq \frac{\pi - 2x}{\pi}$$

Integrating from $0$ to $x$:
$$\sin x \geq \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\pi x - x^2\right) = \frac{x(\pi - x)}{\pi}$$

By the symmetry $\sin(\pi - x) = \sin x$ and $(\pi - x)(x) = x(\pi - x)$, this extends to all of $[0, \pi]$.

### Step 3: Upper Bound ($b = 4/\pi^2$)

Evaluating at $x = \pi/2$:
$$\sin(\pi/2) = 1, \quad \frac{4}{\pi^2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = 1$$

So equality holds at the midpoint. For the bound to be valid, we need $b \geq 4/\pi^2$.

We verify $b = 4/\pi^2$ suffices. Define:
$$\psi(x) = \frac{4(\pi - 2x)}{\pi^2} - \cos x$$

This is the difference of derivatives. Computing:
- $\psi(0) = \frac{4}{\pi} - 1 > 0$ (since $4/\pi \approx 1.27$)
- $\psi(\pi/2) = 0$

The function $\cos x$ is concave on $[0, \pi/2]$, while $\frac{4(\pi-2x)}{\pi^2}$ is linear. A concave function can cross a line at most twice. Since $\psi(0) > 0$ and $\psi(\pi/2) = 0$, by continuity there exists some $c \in (0, \pi/2)$ with $\psi(c) = 0$, and:
- $\psi(x) \geq 0$ on $[0, c]$
- $\psi(x) \leq 0$ on $[c, \pi/2]$

Now let $H(x) = \frac{4x(\pi - x)}{\pi^2} - \sin x$. Then $H(0) = 0$ and $H'(x) = \psi(x)$.

For $x \in [0, c]$: Since $H(0) = 0$ and $H'(x) = \psi(x) \geq 0$, we have $H(x) \geq 0$.

For $x \in [c, \pi/2]$: We compute $H(\pi/2) = 1 - 1 = 0$. Since $H'(x) = \psi(x) \leq 0$ on this interval, $H$ is decreasing from $H(c) \geq 0$ to $H(\pi/2) = 0$. Thus $H(x) \geq 0$ throughout.

By symmetry about $\pi/2$, we have $H(x) \geq 0$ on all of $[0, \pi]$, establishing the upper bound.

### Conclusion

The optimal constants are:
$$\boxed{a = \frac{1}{\pi}, \quad b = \frac{4}{\pi^2}}$$

with equality in the lower bound approached as $x \to 0, \pi$, and equality in the upper bound attained at $x = \pi/2$.
