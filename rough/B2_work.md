# Putnam 2025 B2 - Scratch Work

## Problem Statement

Let $f : [0,1] \to [0, \infty)$ be strictly increasing and continuous. Let $R$ be the region bounded by $x=0,$ $x=1,$ $y=0,$ and $y=f(x).$ Let $x_1$ be the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of $R.$ Let $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of the solid generated by rotating $R$ about the $x$-axis.

Prove that $x_1 < x_2.$

## Step 1: Formulas for Centroids

### Centroid of 2D Region $R$

For a 2D region, the x-coordinate of the centroid is:
$$x_1 = \frac{\int_0^1 x \cdot f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx}$$

**Reasoning:**
- The area element is $dA = f(x) \, dx$
- The moment about the y-axis is $\int x \, dA = \int x f(x) \, dx$
- The total area is $\int dA = \int f(x) \, dx$
- Centroid is moment/area

### Centroid of 3D Solid of Revolution

When we rotate $R$ about the x-axis, the volume element at position $x$ is:
$$dV = \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx$$

The x-coordinate of the centroid is:
$$x_2 = \frac{\int_0^1 x \cdot \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 \pi [f(x)]^2 \, dx} = \frac{\int_0^1 x \cdot [f(x)]^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx}$$

(The $\pi$ cancels out)

---

## Step 2: Setting up the Inequality

We need to prove: $x_1 < x_2$

$$\frac{\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx} < \frac{\int_0^1 x [f(x)]^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx}$$

### Cross-multiplication

Since $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (0,1]$ (strictly increasing from $[0,1]$ to $[0,\infty)$), the denominators are positive. Cross-multiplying preserves the inequality:

$$\left(\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx\right) < \left(\int_0^1 x [f(x)]^2 \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\right)$$

Rearranging:
$$\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx - \int_0^1 x [f(x)]^2 \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx < 0$$

## Step 3: Strategy - Chebyshev's Inequality

**Chebyshev's Sum Inequality:** If $a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n$ and $b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \cdots \leq b_n$, and all weights $w_i > 0$, then:

$$\left(\sum w_i a_i\right) \left(\sum w_i b_i\right) \leq n \left(\sum w_i a_i b_i\right) \left(\sum w_i\right)$$

Actually, the correct continuous version (Chebyshev's integral inequality) states:

If $g$ and $h$ are similarly ordered (both increasing or both decreasing) on $[a,b]$, and $w \geq 0$:
$$\int_a^b w(x) g(x) \, dx \cdot \int_a^b w(x) h(x) \, dx \leq \left(\int_a^b w(x) \, dx\right) \left(\int_a^b w(x) g(x) h(x) \, dx\right)$$

**But we need the opposite direction!**

Let me reconsider...

---

## Step 4: Alternative Approach - Covariance

Define a probability measure on $[0,1]$ with density proportional to $f(x)$:
$$\mu(dx) = \frac{f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(y) \, dy}$$

Then:
$$x_1 = \int_0^1 x \, \mu(dx) = E_\mu[x]$$

Similarly, define another measure with density proportional to $[f(x)]^2$:
$$\nu(dx) = \frac{[f(x)]^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 [f(y)]^2 \, dy}$$

Then:
$$x_2 = \int_0^1 x \, \nu(dx) = E_\nu[x]$$

**Key Insight:** Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $\nu$ places relatively more weight on larger values of $x$ compared to $\mu$.

More precisely, the density ratio is:
$$\frac{d\nu}{d\mu} = \frac{[f(x)]^2 / \int [f]^2}{f(x) / \int f} = \frac{f(x) \cdot \int f}{\int [f]^2}$$

Since $f$ is strictly increasing, this ratio is also strictly increasing in $x$. This means $\nu$ is a "shift to the right" of $\mu$ in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.

---

## Step 5: Correct Approach - Direct Calculation

Let me try a direct approach. We want to show:
$$\int_0^1 x f \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 f^2 \, dx < \int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 f \, dx$$

Rearranging:
$$\int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 f \, dx - \int_0^1 x f \, dx \cdot \int_0^1 f^2 \, dx > 0$$

Let $A = \int_0^1 f$, $B = \int_0^1 f^2$. We need:
$$B \int_0^1 x f \, dx < A \int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx$$

Dividing both sides by $AB > 0$:
$$\frac{\int_0^1 x f \, dx}{A} < \frac{\int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx}{B}$$

Which is exactly $x_1 < x_2$.

---

## Step 6: Using Chebyshev-Correlation Inequality

Consider the covariance-like expression. For measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ defined above:

$$\text{Cov}_\mu(x, f) = E_\mu[xf] - E_\mu[x]E_\mu[f]$$

where the expectation is with respect to $\mu(dx) = f(x)dx / \int f$.

Actually, this is getting circular. Let me think differently.

---

## Step 7: Key Insight - Weighting Effect

The key is that when we go from $f(x)$ to $[f(x)]^2$ as our weight function:
- Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(x)$ is larger for $x$ closer to 1
- When we square $f(x)$, we amplify larger values more than smaller values
- So $[f(x)]^2$ gives even more relative weight to $x$ values near 1
- Therefore the centroid shifts to the right

**Formal proof:** Consider $x, y \in [0,1]$ with $x < y$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing:
$$f(x) < f(y)$$

This means:
$$\frac{f(y)}{f(x)} > 1$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{[f(y)]^2}{[f(x)]^2} = \left(\frac{f(y)}{f(x)}\right)^2 > \frac{f(y)}{f(x)}$$

So the ratio of weights at $y$ vs $x$ is larger under $f^2$ than under $f$.

---

## Step 8: Making it Rigorous - Rearrangement Inequality

**Strategy:** We'll use a comparison argument.

Consider two points $0 \leq x < y \leq 1$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing:
- $f(x) < f(y)$
- $[f(x)]^2 < [f(y)]^2$

The "weight ratio" going from weight function $f$ to weight function $f^2$ is:
$$\rho(x) = \frac{[f(x)]^2}{\int [f]^2} \bigg/ \frac{f(x)}{\int f} = \frac{f(x) \int f}{\int [f]^2}$$

Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $\rho(x)$ is strictly increasing in $x$.

This means $\nu$ (the measure with density $\propto f^2$) gives relatively more weight to larger $x$ values compared to $\mu$ (the measure with density $\propto f$).

By the theory of first-order stochastic dominance: if $\nu$ stochastically dominates $\mu$ (in the sense that $\nu$ shifts weight to the right), then $E_\nu[x] > E_\mu[x]$ for any increasing function (like $x \mapsto x$).

But let me prove this more elementarily...

## Step 9: Elementary Proof via Integration by Parts / Comparison

Let's use a double integral trick. Define:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x) f(y) [f(y) - f(x)] \, dx \, dy$$

**Claim:** $I > 0$ since $f$ is strictly increasing.

**Proof of claim:**
- When $y > x$: $(y - x) > 0$, $f(y) > f(x)$ so $[f(y) - f(x)] > 0$
- When $y < x$: $(y - x) < 0$, $f(y) < f(x)$ so $[f(y) - f(x)] < 0$
- In both cases, the integrand is positive
- When $y = x$, the integrand is 0
- Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we have strict inequality on a set of positive measure

Therefore $I > 0$.

Now let's expand $I$:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x) f(y) [f(y) - f(x)] \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) [f(x) f(y)^2 - f(x)^2 f(y)] \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x) f(y)^2 \, dx \, dy - \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x)^2 f(y) \, dx \, dy$$

For the first term:
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 y f(x) f(y)^2 \, dx \, dy - \int_0^1 \int_0^1 x f(x) f(y)^2 \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \int_0^1 y f(y)^2 \, dy \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx - \int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx \int_0^1 f(y)^2 \, dy$$
$$= \left(\int_0^1 y f^2 \, dy\right) \left(\int_0^1 f \, dx\right) - \left(\int_0^1 x f \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 f^2 \, dy\right)$$

For the second term (by symmetry):
$$\int_0^1 \int_0^1 y f(x)^2 f(y) \, dx \, dy - \int_0^1 \int_0^1 x f(x)^2 f(y) \, dx \, dy$$
$$= \left(\int_0^1 y f \, dy\right) \left(\int_0^1 f^2 \, dx\right) - \left(\int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 f \, dy\right)$$

So:
$$I = \left[\left(\int y f^2\right)\left(\int f\right) - \left(\int x f\right)\left(\int f^2\right)\right] - \left[\left(\int y f\right)\left(\int f^2\right) - \left(\int x f^2\right)\left(\int f\right)\right]$$

$$= 2\left[\left(\int x f^2\right)\left(\int f\right) - \left(\int x f\right)\left(\int f^2\right)\right]$$

Since $I > 0$:
$$\left(\int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f \, dx\right) > \left(\int_0^1 x f \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f^2 \, dx\right)$$

Dividing both sides by $\left(\int f\right)\left(\int f^2\right) > 0$:
$$\frac{\int_0^1 x f^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 f^2 \, dx} > \frac{\int_0^1 x f \, dx}{\int_0^1 f \, dx}$$

Therefore: $x_2 > x_1$. QED!

## Verification of Key Steps

**Why is the integrand always non-negative (and strictly positive on a set of positive measure)?**

For any $(x, y) \in [0,1]^2$:
- If $x < y$: then $y - x > 0$, and since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(y) - f(x) > 0$, and $f(x), f(y) > 0$ (well, $\geq 0$), so the product is $\geq 0$ (and strictly positive if $f(x) > 0$ or on average)
- If $x > y$: then $y - x < 0$, and $f(y) - f(x) < 0$, so $(y-x)[f(y) - f(x)] > 0$, and again multiplying by positive $f(x)f(y)$ gives positive result
- If $x = y$: the integrand is 0

Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $[0,1]$, and maps to $[0, \infty)$, we know that $f$ is not identically zero. Even if $f(0) = 0$, there's a positive measure set where $f > 0$. On the set $\{(x,y) : x \neq y, f(x) > 0, f(y) > 0\}$, which has positive measure, the integrand is strictly positive.

Therefore $I > 0$.

**Why can we use strict inequality?**

Since the integrand is strictly positive on a set of positive measure (specifically, whenever $x \neq y$ and both $f(x), f(y) > 0$), the integral $I$ is strictly positive. This gives us the strict inequality throughout.

## Summary

The proof works by:
1. Setting up formulas for $x_1$ and $x_2$
2. Cross-multiplying to get: prove $(\int xf^2)(\int f) > (\int xf)(\int f^2)$
3. Constructing a double integral $I = \int\int (y-x)f(x)f(y)[f(y) - f(x)] \, dx \, dy$
4. Showing $I > 0$ because $f$ is strictly increasing
5. Expanding $I$ and showing it equals $2[(\int xf^2)(\int f) - (\int xf)(\int f^2)]$
6. Concluding $x_2 > x_1$

The key insight is that the double integral captures the "rearrangement" effect: when we square $f$, we amplify the weights at larger $x$ values more than at smaller $x$ values, shifting the centroid to the right.
