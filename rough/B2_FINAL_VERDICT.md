# Putnam 2025 B2 - Final Verification Report

## Problem Statement

Let $f : [0,1] \to [0,\infty)$ be strictly increasing and continuous. Let $R$ be the region bounded by $x=0$, $x=1$, $y=0$, and $y=f(x)$. Let $x_1$ be the x-coordinate of the centroid of $R$. Let $x_2$ be the x-coordinate of the centroid of the solid generated by rotating $R$ about the x-axis.

**Prove that $x_1 < x_2$.**

## Verification Summary

### 1. Centroid Formulas - CORRECT

**2D Region:**
$$x_1 = \frac{\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx}$$

- Verified against standard calculus definition ✓
- Tested with known cases (rectangle, triangle) ✓
- Numerically verified with 10 different functions ✓

**Solid of Revolution:**
$$x_2 = \frac{\int_0^1 x [f(x)]^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx}$$

- Verified using disk method ✓
- Tested with known cases (cylinder, cone) ✓
- Numerically verified with 10 different functions ✓

### 2. Cross-Multiplication Step - CORRECT

The inequality $x_1 < x_2$ is equivalent to:
$$\left(\int_0^1 x [f(x)]^2 \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\right) > \left(\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx\right) \left(\int_0^1 [f(x)]^2 \, dx\right)$$

- Both denominators are strictly positive (verified) ✓
- Cross-multiplication preserves inequality direction ✓

### 3. Double Integral Construction - CORRECT

The key insight is to consider:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x) f(y) [f(y) - f(x)] \, dx \, dy$$

**Positivity Proof:**
- For $x < y$: $(y-x) > 0$ and $f(y) - f(x) > 0$, so product is positive
- For $x > y$: $(y-x) < 0$ and $f(y) - f(x) < 0$, so product is positive
- For $x = y$: product is zero (measure zero set)
- Since $f(x)f(y) > 0$ on a set of positive measure, $I > 0$ ✓

**Numerical Verification:**
All 10 test functions confirmed $I > 0$:
- $f(x) = x$: $I = 0.0278$
- $f(x) = x^2$: $I = 0.0111$
- $f(x) = e^x - 1$: $I = 0.1001$
- $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$: $I = 0.0444$
- And 6 more cases, all $I > 0$ ✓

### 4. Algebraic Expansion - CORRECT

Starting from:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) f(x) f(y) [f(y) - f(x)] \, dx \, dy$$

**Step 1:** Expand $[f(y) - f(x)]$:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 (y - x) [f(x) f(y)^2 - f(x)^2 f(y)] \, dx \, dy$$

**Step 2:** Expand $(y-x)$ and distribute:
$$I = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 [y f(x) f(y)^2 - x f(x) f(y)^2 - y f(x)^2 f(y) + x f(x)^2 f(y)] \, dx \, dy$$

**Step 3:** Apply Fubini's theorem (valid since integrand is bounded and continuous):
$$I = \left(\int_0^1 y f(y)^2 \, dy\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\right) - \left(\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(y)^2 \, dy\right)$$
$$\quad - \left(\int_0^1 y f(y) \, dy\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x)^2 \, dx\right) + \left(\int_0^1 x f(x)^2 \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(y) \, dy\right)$$

**Step 4:** Rename dummy variables and group:
$$I = 2\left[\left(\int_0^1 x f(x)^2 \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\right) - \left(\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x)^2 \, dx\right)\right]$$

**Verification:**
- Manual algebra check: All steps verified ✓
- Numerical check: Direct computation of $I$ vs. expansion formula
  - Maximum error: $5.36$ out of $10368$ (relative error $< 0.05\%$) for $f(x) = e^{5x} - 1$
  - Typical error: $< 10^{-5}$ for most functions ✓

### 5. Final Conclusion - CORRECT

Since $I > 0$, we have:
$$\left(\int_0^1 x f(x)^2 \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\right) > \left(\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx\right)\left(\int_0^1 f(x)^2 \, dx\right)$$

Dividing by positive quantities:
$$\frac{\int_0^1 x f(x)^2 \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(x)^2 \, dx} > \frac{\int_0^1 x f(x) \, dx}{\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx}$$

Therefore: $x_2 > x_1$ ✓

### 6. Edge Cases - ALL HANDLED

**Case: $f(0) = 0$**
- Example: $f(x) = x$
- Verified: $x_1 = 2/3$, $x_2 = 3/4$, indeed $x_1 < x_2$ ✓

**Case: Steep functions**
- Example: $f(x) = e^{5x} - 1$
- Verified: $x_1 = 0.818$, $x_2 = 0.902$, indeed $x_1 < x_2$ ✓

**Case: Concave vs. Convex**
- Concave: $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, gives $x_1 = 0.600$, $x_2 = 0.667$ ✓
- Convex: $f(x) = x^2$, gives $x_1 = 0.750$, $x_2 = 0.833$ ✓
- Linear: $f(x) = x$, gives $x_1 = 0.667$, $x_2 = 0.750$ ✓

All cases satisfy $x_1 < x_2$.

**YES.** The solution contains no gaps and handles all cases.

### Is the solution rigorous?
**YES.** All steps are justified and all edge cases are handled.

### Would this receive full marks on the Putnam?
**YES, ABSOLUTELY.** This solution demonstrates:
- Correct understanding of the problem
- Proper use of calculus (centroids, double integrals, Fubini's theorem)
- A creative and elegant approach (the double integral construction)
- Complete logical reasoning with no gaps
- Clear presentation

### Rating: 10/10

The solution is excellent and would receive full marks on the Putnam exam.

## What Makes This Solution Strong

1. **Clever Construction:** The double integral $I$ is a beautiful way to capture the "correlation" between position $x$ and weight $f(x)$.

2. **Clean Algebra:** The expansion of $I$ is done systematically and correctly.

3. **Strong Positivity Argument:** The proof that $I > 0$ correctly uses the strict monotonicity of $f$ and handles the diagonal carefully.

4. **Generality:** Works for all strictly increasing continuous functions, with no special cases needed.

5. **Intuition:** The intuition section correctly explains why squaring $f$ shifts the centroid rightward.

## Minor Suggestions (Optional Improvements)

The solution is already excellent, but could optionally:

1. Explicitly state that Fubini's theorem applies (though this is clear to graders)
2. Mention that the set where $f(x)f(y) > 0$ has positive measure (though this is implicit)

However, these are very minor points and the current solution is already complete enough for full marks.

## Conclusion

**The solution is CORRECT and COMPLETE. It deserves FULL MARKS on the Putnam exam.**

No corrections or modifications are needed.
